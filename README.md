## Motivation
<details>
I currently work in a health insurance brokerage space, where I help consult a variety of employers on the costs of their health insurance plans, and also act as a go-between between them and their respective insurance providers. In this line of work, I have had exposure to many different health tech companies and insurance vendors.  Some of them specialize in developing provider recommendation tools, which identify higher quality health providers within a given area based on many different types of metrics.  <br>
<br>
Currently, there is a surprising lack of transparency when it comes to selecting a healthcare provider for the average consumer, in terms of the costs they should expect to incur for a particular service, and the overall quality of care they would be receiving from said providers.  These recommendation tools allow customers to make more informed decisions when choosing doctors and facilities for care, and I was very interested in attemping to build one for myself.

## Data Question

What trends will a text analysis of MPAA movie rating reasons reveal? Have content concerns changed over time? Is the language similar or distinctive between different ratings? What are the the modifying words and phrases connected to frequently occurring words? Are there associations among words such that they often appear in the same ratings together?
